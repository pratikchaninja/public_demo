John Benson's childhood was far from typical, as he was brought up in the picturesque country of Nepal. His father's job as a US counselor led the family to settle in this small, vibrant nation nestled in the Himalayas. Growing up in Nepal exposed John to a rich tapestry of culture, language, and experiences that would shape his worldview in profound ways.

One of the most impactful aspects of John's upbringing in Nepal was his immersion in the local culture and language. From a young age, he learned to speak Nepali fluently, effortlessly blending in with his Nepali peers. This fluency not only allowed him to communicate effectively but also opened doors to deeper connections and understanding of the Nepali way of life.

Despite living in a foreign land, John's childhood was filled with joy and adventure.

Jenny, too, was a foreigner living in Nepal, and the two bonded over their shared experiences of being outsiders in a foreign land. Their friendship blossomed into a deep and lasting love, rooted in a shared history and a mutual understanding of each other's backgrounds.

As John grew older, his father's job eventually led the family back to the United States. The transition was not without its challenges, as John had grown accustomed to life in Nepal and had forged strong connections with the local community.

He excelled in his studies, graduating with top honors and paving the way for a successful career in technology.

Their childhood friendship blossomed into romance, and the two soon realized that they were meant to be together. They tied the knot in a beautiful ceremony, surrounded by family and friends, marking the beginning of a new chapter in their lives.

Today, John looks back on his childhood in Nepal with fondness and gratitude.
